# KKHCLI

KKHCLI is a command line tool for KKHC admins available at

https://github.com/DonBattery/kkhcli

(needs to be dockerized!)

With the help of KKHCLI you can seed the DB with initial data, flush individual collections, list users, add new user, change the password of an existing user. Provided you have the ADMIN_PASSWORD ;)
